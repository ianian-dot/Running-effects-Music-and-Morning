Title: Investigating the factorial effects of Music and Morning on Running Times

Details: 
* Using ANOVA and basic factorial effects, we designed a fully crossed 3 way experiment to investigate the effects of running in the morning and running with music, including their interaction effect. 
* 4 volunteers took part in the experiment, and were used as 'operators' i.e. blockers to increase the precision of the estimates of the factorial effects.
* The runs were randomised to prevent confounding, with a pre-set/pre-planned running schedule randomised on R
